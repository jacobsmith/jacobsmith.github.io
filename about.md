Hello! Thanks for checking out this blog. I run a technology consulting business that focuses on application development - web apps and mobile apps. Historically, I've used Ruby on Rails to help solve problems for clients, though as of late much of my work has revolved around React and React Native for more dynamic user interactions.

I've worked on apps from idea phase through being hosted on the App Store, helped scale companies from 100,000 to 1,000,000 users, and have been a technical lead on a team developing and deploying a HIPAA-compliant application for tracking patient recoveries.

I'd love to chat with you about your business and provide insight into ways I can help you achieve your goals or help you connect with the right people if I'm not the right fit - please email me at [jacob.wesley.smith@gmail.com](mailto:jacob.wesley.smith@gmail.com) and I'd love to buy you a cup of coffee and see what we can make! Looking forward to connecting soon!
